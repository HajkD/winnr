# winnr
## An R package for true winners, e.g. @nand2dave

> In my opinion, every open source developer is a winner.

This package is dedicated to those who make a true contribution to society by sharing their skills, code, and idealism openly with others.


## Install

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
